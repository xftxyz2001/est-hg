## THE QUEST FOR AN ALL-INCLUSIVE HUMAN GENOME(追求全面的人类基因组)

1. Several years ago, after an exhaustive search for uncharted variation in the human genome, Evan Eichler stumbled on something extraordinary. Eichler, a geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues struck on a massive stretch of DNA, about 400,000 letters long, that contained extra copies of genes — probably passed on from an ancient hominin group known as the Denisovans. It appeared in about 80% of people living in Papua New Guinea, but practically nowhere else.(几年前，在对人类基因组中的未知变异进行了详尽的搜索之后，埃文-艾希勒偶然发现了一些不寻常的东西。西雅图华盛顿大学的遗传学家Eichler和他的同事们发现了一段巨大的DNA，大约有40万个字母长，其中含有额外的基因拷贝--可能是从一个被称为丹尼索瓦人的古人类群体中传递过来的。它出现在生活在巴布亚新几内亚的大约80%的人身上，但几乎没有其他地方。)
2. “We were shocked by the size,” Eichler says. “We always knew there would be archaic segments in our genome.” But the segment’s length and its absence in much of the world, he says, “transformed our thinking”.("我们被这个规模震惊了，"艾希勒说。"我们一直知道我们的基因组中会有古老的片段。但他说，这个片段的长度和它在世界大部分地区的缺失，"改变了我们的想法"。)
3. This and other unexpected discoveries have made Eichler and other geneticists increasingly dissatisfied with the breadth and depth of the available maps of the human genome. The first draft genome from the US$2.7-billion Human Genome Project, released in 2001, was meant to become a reference point for future genetic research. But 93% of its sequence came from just 11 individuals, many of whom were recruited through a newspaper advertisement in Buffalo, New York; a whopping 70% of the DNA comes from just one man.(这一发现和其他意外发现使艾希勒和其他遗传学家对现有人类基因组图谱的广度和深度越来越不满意。2001年发布的价值27亿美元的人类基因组计划的第一份基因组草案，旨在成为未来遗传研究的参考点。但是其93%的序列仅来自11个人，其中许多人是通过纽约水牛城的报纸广告招募的；高达70%的DNA仅来自一名男子。)
4. By 2003, that reference genome, known as GRCh38, would be deemed technically complete, but it still had hundreds of gaps and sections containing copious errors. These shortcomings came with consequences. Eichler worked with clinical geneticists at his university’s medical centre and found that the reference genome lacks a region that has variants associated with Baratela-Scott syndrome, which can cause cognitive delays and skeletal malformations in children. Because that portion was missing, there was no quick way for the physicians to check for DNA errors there.(到2003年，被称为GRCh38的参考基因组在技术上被认为是完整的，但是它仍然有数百个缺口和包含大量错误的部分。这些不足之处带来了后果。Eichler与他的大学医学中心的临床遗传学家合作，发现参考基因组缺少一个与巴拉特拉-斯科特综合症有关的变体区域，该综合症可导致儿童的认知迟缓和骨骼畸形。由于缺少这一部分，医生们没有快速的方法来检查那里的DNA错误。)
5. Genome maps have improved, but still don’t adequately capture humanity’s vast diversity. For example, in 2018, one group of researchers sequenced 910 individuals of African descent and discovered a sequence consisting of 300 million DNA letters, or bases, that was unfamiliar2 . That’s roughly 10% of the entire genome.(基因组图已经有所改善，但仍不能充分体现人类的巨大多样性。例如，在2018年，一组研究人员对910名非洲裔个体进行了测序，发现了一个由3亿个DNA字母，或碱基组成的序列，是不熟悉的。这大约是整个基因组的10%。)
6. To create a reference that is more complete and more representative, Eichler has joined forces with a number of high-profile scientists, mostly in the United States. Their goal is to capture almost all human genetic variability — the dizzying number of genetic remixes in the human species, including additions, deletions and other types of mutation.(为了创建一个更完整、更有代表性的参考资料，艾希勒已经与一些高知名度的科学家联手，他们大多在美国。他们的目标是捕捉几乎所有的人类遗传变异性--人类物种中令人眼花缭乱的基因重混，包括添加、删除和其他类型的突变。)
7. Rather than depicting the genome as a linear readout from a single individual, it would contain multiple paths branching in and out like the tangle of train lines on the map for the London Underground. These would represent the varieties of sequence that can be found in different populations, such as the long stretch of DNA found in many people from Papua New Guinea.(与其将基因组描述为来自单一个体的线性读数，不如说它包含了多条分支路径，就像伦敦地铁地图上的纠结的火车线路。这些将代表在不同人群中可以发现的序列品种，例如在巴布亚新几内亚的许多人中发现的长长的DNA。)
8. In 2019, Eichler and his colleagues started the Human Pangenome Project, a $30-million effort funded by the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in Bethesda, Maryland. The initial goal is to do detailed, reference-quality genome sequencing of about 350 people from different backgrounds and to share those data as freely as possible.(2019年，艾希勒和他的同事们开始了人类泛基因组计划，这是由位于马里兰州贝塞斯达的美国国家人类基因组研究中心（NHGRI）资助的一项价值3000万美元的努力。最初的目标是对来自不同背景的约350人进行详细的、具有参考质量的基因组测序，并尽可能免费分享这些数据。)
9. The effort will pose a significant technical challenge, but the scientists behind it, including Karen Miga at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Ting Wang at the Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis,(“MAKING HUMAN VARIATION INTUITIVE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND IS PART OF OUR MISSION.”) argue it is worth it. They see it as crucial to making genomic medicine more equitable3 . “To account for diversity is to better serve humanity,” Wang says. “It is about both equity and equality. It is about building a more inclusive genomic resource for humankind.”(这项工作将带来巨大的技术挑战，但背后的科学家，包括加州大学圣克鲁兹分校的Karen Miga和圣路易斯华盛顿大学医学院的Ting Wang，（"让人类变异变得直观和容易理解是我们任务的一部分。"）认为这是值得的。他们认为这对于使基因组医学更加公平至关重要。"解释多样性是为了更好地服务于人类，"王说。"这是关于公平和平等。这是关于为人类建立一个更具包容性的基因组资源"。)
10. The researchers in the pangenome effort are aware of the history of past missions to capture human genetic diversity, some of which were seen as ‘vampire’ projects that took data from marginalized populations and failed to respect their needs and wishes. In response to this, the pangenome effort engages bioethicists throughout the project, not just at periodic junctures, as was done by initiatives in the past. “They are not a separate entity working in silo, they are involved in every step of the project, including all the technical decisions,” Wang says.(pangenome工作的研究人员意识到过去采集人类遗传多样性的任务的历史，其中一些被视为 "吸血鬼 "项目，从边缘化的人群中获取数据，没有尊重他们的需求和意愿。为了应对这个问题，pangenome的努力让生物伦理学家参与到整个项目中，而不是像过去的倡议那样，只是在定期的关头参与。"他们不是一个单独的实体，他们参与了项目的每一步，包括所有的技术决策，"王说。)
11. Nevertheless, some geneticists focused on the needs of Indigenous communities are wary of the initiative. They aren’t calling for an end to the Human Pangenome Project per se, but they say that marginalized groups deserve control of their genetic data, and of the sequencers, too. “As we position ourselves to be in control of these technologies, we’re empowering our communities,” explains Keolu Fox, a geneticist at the University of California, San Diego, who is Native Hawaiian. “Nothing is as real deal as we are. We’re from our communities.”(然而，一些关注原住民社区需求的遗传学家对这一举措持谨慎态度。他们并没有要求终止人类基因组计划本身，但他们说，边缘化群体应该控制他们的基因数据，也应该控制测序者。"加州大学圣地亚哥分校的遗传学家Keolu Fox解释说："当我们把自己定位为控制这些技术的时候，我们正在赋予我们的社区权力。"没有什么是像我们这样的真实交易。我们来自我们的社区"。)

### Panning out(初见成效)
12. The concept of a pangenome traces back to the study of a bacterium known as Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B streptococcus, which can cause deadly infections in newborns. Scientists analysing six strains of the bacterium published a paper in 2005 trying to capture all of the microbe’s genetic nuances4 . What they produced was a core genome shared by all six strains and a “dispensable” genome of partially shared and strain-specific genes.(pangenome的概念可以追溯到对一种被称为农业链球菌或B组链球菌的研究，这种细菌可以在新生儿中引起致命的感染。科学家们分析了该细菌的六个菌株，于2005年发表了一篇论文，试图捕捉该微生物的所有基因细微差别4。他们得出的结果是所有六个菌株共享的核心基因组，以及部分共享和菌株特定基因的 "可有可无 "的基因组。)
13. It was a tricky task, because bacteria swap and share bits of DNA, even with other species, mostly through a process known as horizontal gene transfer. “There’s a lot of things that can happen in bacteria,” says Candice Hirsch, a plant geneticist at the University of Minnesota in Saint Paul. As a result, biologists are continually updating the bacterial reference genomes. Humans, by contrast, do not add new variation as easily. That makes characterizing a human pangenome more feasible, Hirsch says.(这是一项棘手的任务，因为细菌交换和分享DNA的片段，甚至与其他物种交换和分享，主要是通过一个被称为水平基因转移的过程。"位于圣保罗的明尼苏达大学的植物遗传学家康迪斯-赫希（Candice Hirsch）说："在细菌中可以发生很多事情。因此，生物学家正在不断地更新细菌参考基因组。相比之下，人类不会轻易增加新的变异。Hirsch说，这使得描述一个人类庞然大物的特征更加可行。)
14. But what it lacks in dynamics, the human genome makes up for in length and repetition. Chromosome 1, for example, the largest of the 24 different human chromosomes, stretches over about 250 million base pairs. That’s more than 100 times the length of S. agalactiae. And it is riddled with long stretches of simple, repeated sequences and duplications of other, more complex segments. Until the past decade, scientists’ main option for sequencing DNA involved breaking it into fragments and reading it in small chunks. This allows them to detect single-letter changes in DNA relatively easily. But the short reads make it hard to recognize when a long stretch of DNA contains more than one copy of a gene. Eichler, who has specialized in identifying structural variants such as gene duplications and deletions, has opted for a newer approach, called ‘long-read sequencing’, which analyses bigger stretches of DNA at a time. This is what enabled him to find the previously unnoticed variant in people from Papua New Guinea.(但是，人类基因组在动态方面的不足，在长度和重复性方面得到了弥补。例如，1号染色体是24条不同的人类染色体中最大的一条，长度约为2.5亿个碱基对。那是乳酸菌长度的100多倍。而且它充满了长段的简单重复序列和其他更复杂的片段的重复。直到过去十年，科学家们对DNA进行测序的主要选择是将其分解成片段，并在小块中读取。这使他们能够相对容易地检测DNA中的单字母变化。但是短读数使得他们难以识别一段长的DNA是否包含一个以上的基因副本。Eichler擅长识别结构性变异，如基因复制和缺失，他选择了一种更新的方法，称为 "长读测序"，它一次分析更大的DNA片段。这就是使他能够在巴布亚新几内亚人中发现以前没有注意到的变体的原因。)
15. In 2018, Eichler and other scientists gathered at the NHGRI to discuss a human pangenome effort. There, Eichler reconnected with a fellow scientist who shared his passion for long-read technology, Erich Jarvis, a neuroscientist and molecular biologist at Rockefeller University in New York City.(2018年，Eichler和其他科学家聚集在NHGRI，讨论人类泛基因组的努力。在那里，Eichler与一位与他一样热衷于长读技术的科学家同伴Erich Jarvis重新联系起来，他是纽约市洛克菲勒大学的神经科学家和分子生物学家。)
16. “We kept raising our hands and saying, ‘You’re not going to be able to do that unless you have high-quality reference genomes,’” Jarvis recalls. But long-read sequencing would require more money, and not everyone was keen to deploy it. Jarvis recalls feeling frustrated by some of the debates. “I even chipped a little bit of my front tooth on a fork at a restaurant. I was biting on it so hard,” he says. Ultimately, he and others pushing for the long-read approach won.("Jarvis回忆说："我们一直举手说，'除非你有高质量的参考基因组，否则你不可能做到这一点'。但长读测序需要更多的资金，而且不是每个人都热衷于部署它。贾维斯回忆说，他对一些争论感到很沮丧。"我甚至在一家餐馆的叉子上咬掉了一点门牙。我当时咬得很用力。"他说。最终，他和其他推动长篇阅读方法的人赢了。)
17. Miga, who brings to the project a reputation for completing difficult-to-read sections of DNA, was already using long-read technology. She, along with Jarvis, Eichler and others, published the first-ever completely sequenced human genome, capturing all 3 billion letters, including the messy, highly repetitive sections that cap the ends of chromosomes — known as telomeres . This first telomere-to-telomere genome sequence corrected numerous errors from previous references and uncovered around 100 unnoticed genes that probably code for proteins.(米加为该项目带来了完成难以阅读的DNA部分的声誉，她已经在使用长读技术。她与贾维斯、艾希勒等人一起发表了有史以来第一个完全测序的人类基因组，捕获了所有30亿个字母，包括覆盖在染色体末端的混乱的、高度重复的部分--被称为端粒。这第一个端粒到端粒的基因组序列纠正了以前参考文献中的许多错误，并发现了大约100个未被注意的基因，这些基因可能是编码蛋白质的。)
18. It was no simple feat, however. Typically, human cells contain two sets of 23 chromosomes — one from an egg and one from a sperm cell. But duplicated sequences and other structural DNA variations get jumbled up when machines try to read both sets at the same time. To circumvent this, the scientists analysed the DNA of a cell line derived from what’s known as a molar pregnancy, in which a sperm fertilizes an egg with no nucleus. The DNA contained only one set of chromosomes.(然而，这并不是一个简单的壮举。通常情况下，人类细胞包含两套23条染色体--一套来自卵子，另一套来自精子细胞。但是，当机器试图同时读取两套染色体时，重复的序列和其他结构性的DNA变异会变得混乱不堪。为了规避这个问题，科学家们分析了一个细胞系的DNA，该细胞系来自所谓的磨砂妊娠，即精子使没有细胞核的鸡蛋受精。该DNA只包含一套染色体。)
19. The 350 genomes for the Human Pangenome Project, by contrast, will come from diploid cell lines, that is, cells that contain copies from both parents, so scientists will have to use complex computational tools to tease the genomes apart and make sure they capture the structural variation accurately.(相比之下，人类泛基因组计划的350个基因组将来自二倍体细胞系，即包含来自父母双方的副本的细胞，因此科学家将不得不使用复杂的计算工具来分离基因组，并确保他们准确地捕获结构变异。)
20. The pangenome effort has already completed around 70 detailed genomes. It aims to finish telomere-to-telomere versions of all 350 by the end of the grant, in mid-2024.(pangenome工作已经完成了大约70个详细的基因组。它的目标是在2024年中期拨款结束时完成所有350个端粒到端粒的版本。)
21. And scientists are already working on ways to visualize the diversity and showcase the variations. Up until now, including for the GRCh38 reference genome, the convention has been to have a simple linear representation and a companion database with variations listed for different positions in the sequence, such as single-letter changes. “The community has used this convenient fiction of linear reference sequence for 20 years,” says Benedict Paten, a computational biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Paten, whose office is next to Miga’s, is collaborating with a group to improve the sophistication of the pangenome visualization. In this new visualization, coloured lines represent distinct variants. More-frequent variations are indicated with thicker lines. “Making human variation intuitive and easy to understand is part of our mission in integrating the pangenome,” Paten says (see ‘Visualizing a pangenome’).(而且科学家们已经在研究如何将多样性可视化并展示变异。到目前为止，包括GRCh38参考基因组，惯例是有一个简单的线性表示和一个配套的数据库，其中列出了序列中不同位置的变异，如单字母变化。"加州大学圣克鲁兹分校的计算生物学家Benedict Paten说："社区使用这种方便的线性参考序列的虚构已经20年了。Paten的办公室就在Miga的隔壁，他正在与一个小组合作，以提高pangenome可视化的复杂程度。在这个新的可视化中，彩色的线条代表不同的变体。更频繁的变体用更粗的线条表示。"帕滕说："使人类变异变得直观和容易理解是我们整合庞然大物的任务之一（见'庞然大物的可视化'）。)

### Missteps and departures(误入歧途和离开)
22. Many of the 350 people whose genomes will be analysed in the Human Pangenome Project participated in the 1000 Genomes Project, an effort launched in 2008 to catalogue common and rare variants from 26 diverse populations. The DNA samples that were collected as part of that effort will be retrieved from cold storage and repurposed for the more detailed long-reads of the pangenome sequencing project. The consent forms that those individuals signed years ago also cover the use of their DNA data for the new project. But the Human Pangenome Project is taking further measures to ensure ethical collection and use of genetic data. In contrast to other major genetic sequencing efforts, in which scientists made decisions and then only had them vetted by an Institutional Review Board, for example, the Human Pangenome Project has social ethicists who are “embedded” in the decision-making process and continuously vetting the project, Eichler says.(在人类彭根组项目中，其基因组将被分析的350人中，有许多人参加了1000个基因组项目，该项目于2008年启动，旨在对26个不同人群的常见和罕见变异进行编目。作为这项工作的一部分而收集的DNA样本将被从冷库中取出，并被重新用于更详细的彭根组测序项目的长读。这些人多年前签署的同意书也涵盖了他们的DNA数据在新项目中的使用。但是人类彭格列项目正在采取进一步的措施来确保基因数据的道德收集和使用。Eichler说，与其他主要的基因测序工作相比，例如，科学家做出决定后只由机构审查委员会审核，而人类彭格列项目有社会伦理学家，他们 "嵌入 "决策过程中，并不断审核该项目。)
23. As Wang puts it: “It’s really about how to guide the nerdy scientists who may not think about social issues to do their science in the most appropriate manner.”(正如Wang所说。"这其实是关于如何引导那些可能不考虑社会问题的书呆子科学家以最适当的方式进行科学研究。")
24. In many ways, the leaders of the pangenome project are trying to overcome the ethically thorny legacy of past endeavours. The Human Genome Diversity Project, for example, launched in 1991 as an effort to collect DNA information from people around the globe, engendered staunch opposition from several communities. Indigenous groups, among others, felt they were being treated as living fossils, headed towards extinction(6).(在许多方面，泛基因组项目的领导人正在努力克服过去努力的伦理上的棘手问题。例如，人类基因组多样性项目于1991年启动，旨在收集全球各地人们的DNA信息，但遭到了一些社区的强烈反对。土著群体等认为他们被当作活的化石，正在走向灭亡（6）。)
25. “Scientists were collecting Indigenous peoples’ genomic data largely for the benefit of other, non-Indigenous peoples, which, when done without regards to Indigenous data sovereignty, is a means of continued data extraction,” says Krystal Tsosie, a geneticist and bioethicist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and a member of the Navajo Nation.("田纳西州纳什维尔范德比尔特大学的遗传学家和生物伦理学家、纳瓦霍族成员Krystal Tsosie说："科学家收集土著人民的基因组数据主要是为了其他非土著人民的利益，如果不考虑土著数据的主权，这就是一种继续提取数据的手段。)
26. The next decade brought even more concern over ethical transgressions in genetic studies of under-represented groups, notably when the Havasupai Tribe filed a lawsuit against the Arizona Board of Regents and Arizona State University researchers in 2004. Members of the tribe had donated their DNA for genetic studies on type 2 diabetes, but discovered that it had been used without their consent for studies on schizophrenia and migration(7).(接下来的十年里，人们更加关注对代表性不足的群体进行的基因研究中的伦理违规行为，特别是2004年，哈瓦苏派部落对亚利桑那州立大学的管理委员会和研究人员提起诉讼。该部落的成员捐赠了他们的DNA用于2型糖尿病的遗传研究，但发现这些DNA被用于精神分裂症和移民的研究，而没有得到他们的同意。)
27. The researchers had also used stigmatizing words such as ‘inbreeding’ to explain genetic phenomena that were actually the consequence of population bottlenecks related to genocidal events, says Tsosie. She adds that, in the past, geneticists doing sequencing projects have often used racial language and failed to properly acknowledge the lasting legacy of colonialism in science, and the threat it poses to Indigenous people.(Tsosie说，研究人员还使用了 "近亲繁殖 "等污名化的词语来解释遗传现象，而这些现象实际上是与种族灭绝事件有关的人口瓶颈造成的。她补充说，在过去，做测序项目的遗传学家经常使用种族语言，没有正确承认科学中殖民主义的持久遗产，以及它对原住民构成的威胁。)
28. For several years, Fox and others have been calling for a massive departure from this approach. They say that Indigenous groups should have greater agency when it comes to the collection of their genetic data. Fox, who was a graduate student in Eichler’s lab, says that he’s not convinced that the pangenome project and others like it are involving the diverse groups they seek to sample in a way that truly empowers them. “I love Evan, man. When I have problems, I call him for advice,” he says. “Despite that, you know, we don’t agree on everything.”( 几年来，福克斯和其他人一直在呼吁大规模改变这种做法。他们说，当涉及到收集他们的基因数据时，原住民群体应该有更大的代理权。福克斯曾是艾希勒实验室的研究生，他说他不相信pangenome项目和其他类似项目是以一种真正赋予他们权力的方式让他们所寻求的不同群体参与其中。"我爱埃文，伙计。当我遇到问题时，我打电话给他征求意见，"他说。"尽管如此，你知道，我们并不是什么都同意。")
29. Fox advocates for an approach that puts sequencing power in the hands of the people. He and Tsosie are involved in the Native BioData Consortium, a non-profit research institute led by Indigenous scientists and tribal members in the United States that has been working to help Indigenous groups to acquire and run DNA sequencers on their own territory. The first sequencer was delivered to the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation in December 2020 says consortium co-founder Joseph Yracheta, a public-health geneticist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. In February, Yracheta joined a Human Pangenome Project working group focused on ethical, legal and social implications of the project.(福克斯主张采取一种将测序权交到人民手中的方法。他和Tsosie参与了Native BioData Consortium，这是一个由美国土著科学家和部落成员领导的非营利性研究机构，一直致力于帮助土著群体在自己的领土上获得并运行DNA测序仪。联合会联合创始人约瑟夫-伊拉切塔（Joseph Yracheta）说，第一台测序仪已于2020年12月交付给夏延河苏族保留区，他是巴尔的摩约翰霍普金斯大学彭博公共卫生学院的公共卫生遗传学家。今年2月，Yracheta加入了一个人类彭格列项目工作组，该工作组专注于项目的伦理、法律和社会影响。)
30. Fox is currently focused on genetic complexity found in the Pacific islands. He and his team mates are taking a holistic approach to sequence the genomes of agricultural species and other organisms in the environment in tandem, and are building a genomics institute to serve the community. Fox notes that the latest technologies, such as a ‘distributed ledger’ computer system that securely ties a person to their genetic data, can give people greater autonomy about whom they allow to access and use their information. “There are so many advancements in the data sciences right now that really allow for a new level of agency for participants,” Fox says.(福克斯目前专注于在太平洋岛屿发现的遗传复杂性。他和他的队友们正在采取一种整体的方法，对农业物种和环境中的其他生物的基因组进行串联测序，并正在建立一个基因组学研究所来为社区服务。福克斯指出，最新的技术，例如将一个人与他们的基因数据安全地联系在一起的 "分布式账本 "计算机系统，可以让人们对他们允许谁访问和使用他们的信息有更大的自主权。"福克斯说："现在的数据科学有很多进步，真正允许参与者有一个新的代理水平。)
31. Eichler is supportive of Fox’s path. “I applaud his efforts to engage Indigenous scientists into genomics research — we need more of it,” Eichler says. “It is not an either–or scenario, however, in my opinion.” He adds that the Human Pangenome Project is encouraging Indigenous scientists to generate their own reference genomes. In those scenarios, “we will work together to make it happen by providing expertise and tools as needed”.(Eichler对Fox的道路表示支持。"Eichler说："我赞赏他让土著科学家参与基因组学研究的努力 - 我们需要更多这样的研究。"然而，在我看来，这不是一个非此即彼的方案。" 他补充说，人类庞然大物计划正在鼓励土著科学家生成他们自己的参考基因组。在这些情况下，"我们将通过提供所需的专业知识和工具来共同实现这一目标"。)

### No mutation without representation(没有代表就没有变异)
32. Tsosie says that Indigenous groups might collaborate with big diversity projects in the future, but that it would have to happen in a way that would ensure that such communities can do their own sequencing. Moreover, although these major genome projects are often open-data efforts, Tsosie says it would be wise for there to be protections added for Indigenous people’s deposited DNA sequences such that they be available only through access requests to avoid exploitation. “If it’s going to happen, it needs to happen in the best way that represents Indigenous people,” she says.(Tsosie说，土著群体将来可能会与大型多样性项目合作，但这必须以一种确保这些社区能够进行自己的测序的方式进行。此外，尽管这些主要的基因组项目通常是开放数据的努力，Tsosie说，明智的做法是为土著人存放的DNA序列增加保护措施，例如只有通过访问请求才能获得这些序列，以避免剥削。"她说："如果它要发生，它需要以代表原住民的最佳方式发生。)
33. It’s not just advocates from Indigenous communities in the United States who have voiced concerns about representation and data ownership. Others have argued that the pangenome project hasn’t adequately involved researchers from regions outside the United States, according to Jarvis, who is on the project’s sampling committee. He recognizes that some see the initiative as a largely US effort, but says that he and his collaborators are working to broaden it and involve scientists and participants from different parts of the world. For example, they have reached out to leaders of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) programme to involve scientists in Africa who can do sequencing in countries there. (No sequencing effort seems immune from ethical challenges, however — even the H3Africa programme has had to straddle different countries’ rules and norms governing the use of participant data, for example.)(不仅仅是来自美国原住民社区的倡导者对代表性和数据所有权表示担忧。据贾维斯说，其他一些人认为，该项目没有充分地让美国以外地区的研究人员参与进来，他是该项目采样委员会的成员。他承认有些人认为该项目主要是美国的努力，但他说他和他的合作者正在努力扩大该项目，让来自世界不同地区的科学家和参与者参与进来。例如，他们已经与非洲人类遗传与健康（H3Africa）计划的领导人取得联系，让非洲的科学家参与进来，他们可以在那里的国家进行测序。(然而，任何测序工作似乎都无法避免伦理方面的挑战--例如，即使是H3Africa计划也不得不跨越不同国家关于使用参与者数据的规则和规范）。)
34. Jarvis says he wants the Human Pangenome Project to achieve a better representation of human genetic diversity. “I’m a person of colour. I grew up as an African American. I grew up as an under-represented minority in the sciences,” he says. “My diversity is not represented. So I have a personal motivation and a societal one to make sure that this pangenome really represents populations.”(贾维斯说，他希望人类庞然大物项目能更好地代表人类的遗传多样性。"我是一个有色人种。我是作为一个非裔美国人长大的。他说："我是作为一个在科学界代表性不足的少数民族长大的。"我的多样性没有被代表。因此，我有一个个人动机和一个社会动机，以确保这个庞然大物真正代表人群。")
35. As they push forwards, the scientists also acknowledge that 350 genomes will not represent all human diversity. Ultimately, the true number of genomes needed to do this is difficult to pin down, and genetics often teaches us that rare differences can be important. “I don’t think there is any magic number,” says Adam Phillippy, head of the Genome Informatics Section at the NHGRI, and an investigator on the pangenome project.(在他们向前推进的同时，科学家们也承认，350个基因组不会代表所有的人类多样性。归根结底，真正需要的基因组数量很难确定，而且遗传学经常告诉我们，罕见的差异可能是重要的。"我不认为有什么神奇的数字，"美国国家卫生研究院基因组信息学科科长Adam Phillippy说，他也是pangenome项目的调查员。)
36. Juggling the massive scientific undertaking while trying to avoid ethical pitfalls is something that weighs heavily on the pangenome researchers. “I’m sure there will be things that we will do that people will criticize five or ten years from now. I’m almost 100% sure of it,” Eichler says. “But if we can go in with a clear conscience and say, we tried to do everything we possibly could to do it right, I feel that that’s something.”(在努力避免道德陷阱的同时，还要兼顾庞大的科学事业，这一点对庞然大物的研究人员来说非常重要。"我确信，从现在起五年或十年后，我们将做一些人们会批评的事情。我几乎百分之百肯定，"艾希勒说。"但是，如果我们能够问心无愧地去说，我们试图做一切可能做的事情，我觉得那是一件好事。")
